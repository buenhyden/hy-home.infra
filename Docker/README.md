## Issue Tracker

- [Tegon](https://www.tegon.ai/)
  - The AI-first Issue Tracking Tool.
  - Issue Tracking is important for fast-paced teams, enabling them to organize list of tasks, collaborate, and track progress effectively. However, existing tools often introduce the following challenges:
    - Manual efforts in task management, such as task triaging and backlog maintenance, can be time-consuming.
    - Engineers often loose time navigating multiple platforms to gather task context, rather than accessing details within the task itself.
    - Issue tracking tools serve as a task database, directing engineers on what to work on but not aiding in faster task completion.
    - Existing tools don't effectively assist Engineering Managers in real-time task, feature, or bug prioritisation.
  - Features
    - Issues Tracking (List and Kanban View)
    - Automatically create a title from the description, eliminating the need to spend time crafting the perfect title
